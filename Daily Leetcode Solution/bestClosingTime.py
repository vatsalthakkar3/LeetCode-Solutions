    LeetCode Problem - 2483. Minimum Penalty for a Shop

    You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a 0-indexed string customers consisting only of characters 'N' and 'Y':

    -> if the ith character is 'Y', it means that customers come at the ith hour
    -> whereas 'N' indicates that no customers come at the ith hour.
    
    If the shop closes at the jth hour (0 <= j <= n), the penalty is calculated as follows:

    -> For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty increases by 1.
    -> For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty increases by 1.
    
    Return the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum penalty.

    Note that if a shop closes at the jth hour, it means the shop is closed at the hour j.
